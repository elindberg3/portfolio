        <div class="information"><p>Hello! My name is Erin Lindberg, and I am in my third year at University Wisconsin - Eau Claire. I am currently studying Graphic Communications. This is my first full year with that as my major, and so far I am really enjoying it!</p>
        <p>I am a big fan of art, especially digital art, ceramics, collaging, and photography. I try to incorporate art into my every day life. I have been taking on and off ceramics classes for the past 6 years, and would love to continue in my future. I also would love to investigate more into photography. Another big interest of mine is music. I listen to music, all types of genres, constantly and have always wondered how I can incorporate that into my future. I am also a big fan of traveling and would love to embrace that more!</p>
        <p>I have been working in the food industry since my first job. During the summer after my sophomore year of high school, summer of 2019, I started my first job at Panera Bread, and after working there for a couple of years, I left for college in the fall. I ended up working at Tonoâ€™s Pizzeria and Cheesesteaks for my summer going into sophomore year of college, and that upcoming winter break. I got my first job in Eau Claire as a server at 44 North this past February in 2023, and have been working there since! </p></div>
